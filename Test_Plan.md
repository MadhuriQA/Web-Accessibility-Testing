# What is a Test Plan?

Test Plan is a dynamic document. The success of a testing project depends on a well written test plan document that is current at all times. Test Plan is more or less like a blue print of how the testing activity is going to take place in a project.

# Importance of Test Plan 

- Test Plan helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the application  under test
- Help people outside the test team such as developers, business managers, customers understand the details of testing.
- Test Plan guides our thinking. It is like a rule book, which needs to be followed.
- Important aspects like test estimation, test scope, test strategy are documented in Test Plan, so it can be reviewed by Management Team and re-used for other projects.

# It has clear information on the following aspects:

1) Scope =>	Test scenarios/Test objectives that will be validated.
	
   - Out of scope =>	Enhanced clarity on what we are not going to cover
	
2) Assumptions =>	All the conditions that need to hold true for us to be able to proceed successfully
	
3) Schedules =>	Test scenario prep
	 - Test documentation- test cases/test data/setting up environment
	 - Test execution
	 - Test cycle- how many cycle
	 - Start and end date for cycles
	
4) Roles and Responsibilities => Team members are listed
	 - Who is to do what
	 - module owners are listed and their contact info
	
5) Deliverables => 	What documents(test artifacts) are going to produce at what time frames, What can be expected from each document
	
6) Environment =>  What kind of environment requirements exist
	 - Who is going to be in charge
	 - What to do in case of problems
	
7) Tools => For example: JIRA for bug tracking
	 - Login
	 - How to use JIRA
	
8) Defect Management => Who are we going to report the defects to
	 - How are we going to report
	 - What is expected- do we provide screenshot?
	
9) Risks and Risk Management => Risks are listed
	 - Risks are analyzed- likelihood and impact is documented
	 - Risk mitigation plans are drawn
	
10) Exit criteria => 	When to stop testing

NOTE - Since, all the above information is the most critical for the day-to-day working of a QA project, it is important to keep the Test Plan document updated at all times.

# Prerequisites of  a Test Plan

1.Analyze the product
   - Who will use the website?
   - What is it used for?
   - How will it work?
   - What are software/ hardware the product uses?
   
2.Design the Test Strategy
   - The project’s testing objectives and the means to achieve them
   - Determines testing effort and costs

3.Define Test Criteria
    - Suspension Criteria - Specify the critical suspension criteria for a test. If the suspension criteria are met during testing, the active test cycle will be suspended until the criteria are resolved.    
    - Exit Criteria - It specifies the criteria that denote a successful completion of a test phase. The exit criteria are the targeted results of the test and are necessary before proceeding to the next phase of development.
    
4.Define the Test Objectives
    - List all the software features (functionality, performance, GUI…) which may need to test.
    - Define the target or the goal of  the test based on  above features

5.Resource Planning
Resource plan is a detailed summary of all types of resources required to complete project task. Resource could be human, equipment and materials needed to complete a project

6.Plan Test Environment - A testing environment is a setup of software and hardware on which the testing team is going to execute test cases.
  - What is the maximum user connection which this website can handle at the same time?
  - What are hardware/software requirements to install this website?
  - Does the user's computer need any particular setting to browse the website?

7.Schedule & Estimation
  - Employee and project deadline: The working days, the project deadline, resource availability are the factors which affected to the schedule
  - Project estimation:  Base on the estimation, the Test Manager knows how long it takes to complete the project. So he can make the appropriate project schedule
  - Project Risk : Understanding the risk helps Test Manager add enough extra time to the project schedule to deal with the risks
  
8.Determine Test Deliverables - 

***Test deliverables are provided before testing phase***
 - Test plans document.
 - Test cases documents
 - Test Design specifications.

***Test deliverables are provided during the testing*** 
 - Test Scripts
 - Simulators.
 - Test Data
 - Test Traceability Matrix
 - Error logs and execution logs.

***Test deliverables are provided after the testing cycles is over***
 - Test Results/report
 - Defect Report
 - Installation/ Test procedures guidelines
 - Release notes
